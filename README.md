## 📖 Project Description

**Wallet Reputation Graph** is a fully on-chain, decentralized reputation system built on the **Stellar blockchain** using the **Soroban smart contract SDK**. It allows any participant in the Stellar ecosystem to register a wallet identity, receive peer endorsements for trustworthy behaviour, and accumulate (or lose) reputation points based on community-driven reports.

Every interaction — registration, endorsement, or report — is permanently logged on-chain with a timestamp and a human-readable reason. Reputation scores are calculated deterministically from on-chain data: each endorsement adds **+1** point and each negative report deducts **−3** points, creating a weighted signal where bad behaviour has a meaningfully higher impact than isolated endorsements.

The contract exposes a clean, minimal API of **4 core functions** (plus 2 view helpers), making it easy to integrate into wallets, dApps, DEXes, and DeFi protocols that need a trust signal before executing high-value transactions.

---

## 📸 Product Showcase

The application pairs the Soroban smart contract with a clean frontend so users can explore wallet reputation, submit trust signals, and inspect credibility at a glance.

### Landing Page

<div align="center">
  <img width="1239" height="841" alt="Wallet Reputation Graph landing page" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/698e88be-383b-45ae-ad98-9b87d6513e37" />
</div>

The landing page introduces the protocol, highlights live ecosystem stats, and guides new users into connecting their wallet and joining the reputation network.

### Dashboard Overview

<div align="center">
  <img width="767" height="830" alt="Wallet Reputation Graph dashboard overview" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4152618f-8cea-4001-ad71-9dd8ca5c5f69" />
</div>

The dashboard is the main control center. From here, users can register a wallet, search any profile by wallet ID or Stellar address, and inspect current reputation metrics in one place.

### Trust Actions: Endorse or Report

<div align="center">
  <img width="792" height="733" alt="Wallet dashboard actions for endorsing or reporting a project" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4b97e6d-b7a6-4536-9d03-5fffdedb068b" />
</div>

- **Endorse a wallet:** submit a positive trust signal for reliable behavior. Each endorsement adds **+1** to the wallet score.
- **Report a project or wallet:** flag suspicious or malicious activity so the community can react early. Each report deducts **−3** from the wallet score.

### Credibility View

<div align="center">
  <img width="772" height="788" alt="Wallet credibility and reputation view" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4de4195-ac54-4500-a094-064c2ff735f5" />
</div>

This view helps users quickly evaluate whether a wallet looks credible by surfacing its score, endorsement count, report count, and overall trust posture in an easy-to-read format.

---

## 🔭 Project Vision

The DeFi and Web3 ecosystem suffers from an acute **trust deficit**. Pseudonymous wallet addresses provide no inherent signal of reliability, past behaviour, or community standing. This forces users to rely on off-chain reputations (Twitter profiles, Discord handles) that are easily faked, siloed, and non-composable.

**Wallet Reputation Graph** envisions a future where:

> *Every Stellar wallet carries a transparent, tamper-proof, community-curated trust score that any dApp can query in real time — no central authority required.*

By anchoring reputation data directly on the Stellar ledger via Soroban, we eliminate the need for off-chain oracles, centralised databases, or trusted third parties. The graph grows organically as the community endorses good actors and reports bad ones, creating a **living, self-correcting social trust layer** for the entire Stellar ecosystem.

Long-term, this contract is designed to serve as a primitive — a composable building block that other protocols on Stellar can build upon, much like how ERC-20 became a universal token standard on Ethereum.

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🆔 **Wallet Registration** | Any participant can register a new wallet identity and receive a unique, auto-incremented `wallet_id` on-chain. |
| 👍 **Peer Endorsements** | Users can endorse any registered wallet with a short on-chain reason string, boosting its reputation score by +1. |
| 🚩 **Negative Reports** | Users can submit weighted negative reports (−3 per report) against wallets that have behaved maliciously or dishonestly. |
| 📊 **Live Reputation Scores** | Reputation scores are computed and stored on-chain at every interaction — no off-chain computation needed. |
| 📜 **Immutable Interaction Log** | Every endorsement and report is stored as an `InteractionLog` entry with a timestamp, reason, and log ID — fully auditable. |
| 🌍 **Global Statistics** | A real-time `GlobalStats` struct tracks total wallets, total endorsements, and total reports across the entire platform. |
| ⚖️ **Weighted Scoring** | Reports carry 3× the weight of endorsements, ensuring that community warnings are meaningful signal, not noise. |
| ♻️ **Composable Design** | Clean, minimal function surface makes it easy to integrate as a reputation oracle into other Soroban contracts or dApps. |

### Contract Functions

#### 🔵 Mutating Functions

```
register_wallet(env) → wallet_id: u64
```
Registers a new wallet. Returns the auto-assigned `wallet_id`. Initialises score to `0` and `is_active` to `true`. Updates `GlobalStats.total_wallets`.

---

```
endorse_wallet(env, target_wallet_id: u64, reason: String) → log_id: u64
```
Submits a positive endorsement for the target wallet. Adds `+1` to `score`. Creates an `InteractionLog` entry. Updates `GlobalStats.total_endorsements`. Returns the `log_id`. Panics if the wallet does not exist or is inactive.

---

```
report_wallet(env, target_wallet_id: u64, reason: String) → log_id: u64
```
Submits a negative report against the target wallet. Subtracts `3` from `score`. Creates an `InteractionLog` entry. Updates `GlobalStats.total_reports`. Returns the `log_id`. Panics if the wallet does not exist or is inactive.

#### 🟢 Read-only Functions

```
view_wallet_reputation(env, wallet_id: u64) → ReputationRecord
```
Returns the full `ReputationRecord` for a given `wallet_id`. Returns a zeroed-out default if the ID is not found.

---

```
view_global_stats(env) → GlobalStats
```
Returns the platform-wide `GlobalStats` singleton.

---

```
view_interaction_log(env, log_id: u64) → InteractionLog
```
Returns a single `InteractionLog` entry by its `log_id`. Returns a zeroed-out default if not found.

---

## ⚖️ Score Mechanics

```
score = (endorsements × +1) + (reports × −3)
```

| Scenario | Score Impact |
|---|---|
| 1 endorsement | +1 |
| 1 report | −3 |
| 3 endorsements + 1 report | 0 (net neutral) |
| 10 endorsements + 5 reports | −5 (net negative) |
| 10 endorsements + 0 reports | +10 (strong positive) |

> **Design rationale:** A 3× penalty ensures that a single malicious act cannot be trivially "washed out" by a burst of cheap endorsements. At least 3 endorsements are required to neutralise every report, encouraging organic reputation building over gaming.

Scores are stored as `i64` and **can go negative** — there is no floor. A deeply negative score is a strong on-chain warning signal.

## 🔮 Future Scope

The current contract establishes a solid, minimal on-chain reputation primitive. The following enhancements are planned for future iterations:

### 🔑 Wallet Address Binding
Replace the internal numeric `wallet_id` with the actual `Address` type from `soroban_sdk` so that reputation records are natively tied to real Stellar public keys — eliminating the need for a separate registration step and making the system self-sovereign by default.

### 🏷️ Category-Based Reputation
Introduce multi-dimensional reputation by allowing endorsements and reports to be tagged with categories (e.g., `Trading`, `Lending`, `NFT`, `DAO Governance`). This enables dApps to query a wallet's trust score within a specific domain rather than relying solely on a global aggregate.

### 🛡️ Sybil Resistance Mechanisms
Integrate Stellar account age, minimum XLM balance thresholds, or Soroban-based zero-knowledge proof verifications to make it significantly harder for bad actors to create fresh wallets and game the endorsement system.

### 🗳️ Stake-Weighted Voting
Allow endorsers and reporters to optionally attach a stake in XLM or a Stellar asset. Higher-stake interactions carry proportionally more weight in the score, aligning economic incentives with honest behaviour.

### 🤝 Cross-Contract Composability
Expose a standardised interface (similar to an ABI) so that other Soroban smart contracts — DEX order books, lending protocols, NFT marketplaces — can call `view_wallet_reputation` in real time as a gating condition before executing high-value operations.

### 📡 Event Emission
Leverage Soroban's event system (`env.events().publish(...)`) to emit structured events on every endorsement and report, enabling off-chain indexers, analytics dashboards, and reputation-explorer frontends to track changes in near real time.

### ⏳ Time-Decayed Scoring
Implement an optional score decay model where interactions older than a configurable ledger window contribute less to the current score — ensuring that wallets cannot rest on historical laurels and must maintain consistently good behaviour over time.

### 🌉 Cross-Chain Reputation Bridging
Explore bridges to import reputation signals from other blockchains (Ethereum ENS scores, Lens Protocol, etc.) via Stellar-compatible oracles, creating a unified multi-chain reputation identity for power users.
